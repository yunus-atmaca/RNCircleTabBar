## Run Application
First, you will need to complete [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) then close the project and install dependencies using ``yarn``.
```bash
# start Metro
yarn start
# run the application(ios or android)
yarn ios | android
```

# Troubleshooting
The project does not utilize any UI scaling algorithms/libraries, so it may not adjust perfectly to devices of varying sizes. I tested the project using an iPhone 15 Pro. It simply provides an idea of how to implement it.
